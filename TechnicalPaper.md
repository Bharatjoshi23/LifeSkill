# SOLID Principles and Code Refactoring - Technical Report

I recently joined a new project with a challenging and unmanageable codebase. In response to this, I undertook a mission to improve the codebase's maintainability and extensibility by applying the SOLID principles. These principles are fundamental to writing clean and comprehensible code. In this report, I will provide an overview of each SOLID principle with Java code samples, demonstrating their importance in code refactoring.

## SOLID Principles

1. **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):** This principle advocates that each class should have a single reason to change. It leads to code that is easier to understand, test, and maintain. For instance:

    ```java
    public class Customer {
        public void calculateDiscount() {
            // ...
        }

        public void sendNotification() {
            // ...
        }
    ```

2. **Open-Closed Principle (OCP):** The OCP suggests that software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification. This allows for the addition of new features without altering existing code. An example is:

    ```java
    public abstract class Shape {
        public abstract double area();
    }

    public class Circle extends Shape {
        public double area() {
            // ...
        }
    ```

3. **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP):** According to LSP, subtypes must be substitutable for their base types without affecting the correctness of the program. An illustration is:

    ```java
    public abstract class Bird {
        public abstract void move();
    }

    public class Ostrich extends Bird {
        public void move() {
            // ...
        }
    ```

4. **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP):** The ISP asserts that clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use. This leads to classes implementing only necessary methods. Here's an example:

    ```java
    public interface Workable {
        void work();
    }

    public interface Eatable {
        void eat();
    }

    public class Worker implements Workable, Eatable {
        // ...
    ```

5. **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP):** DIP suggests that high-level modules should not depend on low-level modules; both should depend on abstractions. For instance:

    ```java
    public interface Switchable {
        void turnOn();
    }

    public class LightBulb implements Switchable {
        public void turnOn() {
            // ...
        }

    public class Switch {
        private Switchable device;

        public Switch(Switchable device) {
            this.device = device;
        }

        public void operate() {
            device.turnOn();
        }
    ```

## Conclusion

By applying the SOLID principles, we can significantly enhance the quality and maintainability of the codebase. This, in turn, simplifies code refactoring, testing, and the extension of software systems.
