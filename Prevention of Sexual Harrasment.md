1. **What kinds of behavior cause sexual harassment?**

   Sexual harassment can be caused by:
   - When someone makes unwelcome sexual comments, requests, or gestures towards another person without their consent.
   - Making offensive, sexual, or suggestive remarks, or sharing explicit jokes that create discomfort or distress for others.
   - Invading someone's personal boundaries, such as touching them without permission or making them feel unsafe or uncomfortable in a sexual manner.

2. **What would you do in case you face or witness any incident or repeated incidents of such behavior?**

   If I faced or witnessed sexual harassment:
   - I would assertively but calmly address the behavior, letting the person know it's not acceptable.
   - I'd offer my help and encourage the victim to report the incident to the appropriate authority.
   - I'd take note of the incident details and report it to a supervisor, HR, or relevant authorities to ensure proper action is taken.

3. **Explains different scenarios enacted by actors.**
   - Unwanted advances: An actor might portray someone making unwelcome sexual advances, like persistent flirting or touching, to another actor who feels uncomfortable.
   - Inappropriate comments: Actors may demonstrate the use of sexually explicit language, jokes, or comments that create a hostile environment for others.
   - Power dynamics: Scenarios might depict an actor in a position of authority exploiting that power to pressure another actor into unwanted sexual situations, illustrating the abuse of authority in a workplace or social setting.

4. **How to handle cases of harassment?**
   - Support the victim: Listen and offer empathy to the person experiencing harassment, letting them know you believe and stand by them.
   - Document the incidents: Encourage the victim to keep a record of what happened and when, including any evidence, to aid in reporting.
   - Report to authorities: Help the victim report the harassment to HR, law enforcement, or relevant authorities for proper investigation and action.

5. **How to behave appropriately?**
   - Respect others: Treat people with kindness, courtesy, and consideration, regardless of their background or beliefs.
   - Follow rules and norms: Adhere to societal and workplace rules, customs, and guidelines to ensure you don't offend or harm others.
   - Communicate openly: Express your thoughts and feelings honestly, but with sensitivity, and listen to others to foster healthy interactions.
