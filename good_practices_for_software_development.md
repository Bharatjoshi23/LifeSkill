**Points that were new to me:**

- The way you ask a question determines whether it will be answered or not. You need to make it very easy for the person to answer your question. Messages like "the database is not connecting, need your help" or "the build is not working, can you help me out" will not get you the answers you are looking for.

- You should strongly consider blocking social media sites and apps during work hours. Tools like TimeLimit, Freedom, or any other app can be helpful.

**Area for Improvement and Ideas for Progress:**

I need to improve at keeping my team informed and ensuring everyone understands our work when we're working remotely. To make progress in this area, I plan to:

- Share more frequent updates with the team.
- Make it easy for my team to ask questions and seek clarification.
- Focus on staying productive and avoiding distractions during work.
